# Shiny_App
My very first Shiny App: "Who let the dogs out?"

You can read more detailed information on where I got the dataset and how I cleaned it from my blogpost: https://smitha-achar.com/portfolio/my-first-shiny-app/
For a high level understanding, make sure you have all the packages as mentioned in the ui.R script and server.R script otherwise your RStudio might throw some odd errors. If you run into any problems, I'd be happy to help!
